# Keyboard Assistant

**Keyboard Assistant** is a software designed to convert any point-and-click game into a keyboard-based game! It allows users to bind mouse movements and keyboard clicks to any valid keyboard key. This software is intended for personal, educational, and/or commercial use and is distributed under the terms of the custom license described in the LICENSE file.

Also included in this care package is Position.exe, which will display your mouse's current local AND global
position, every second! Simply press ENTER on your keyboard to copy the coordinates to your clipboard for
easy access!

## Usage & Configuration

### Pause
To pause the program at any time, simply use the configurable pause hotkey found in the config.txt file! By
default, the hotkey is set to CTRL+SPACE.

### Configuration Files
 - All configuration can be accessed via the provided config.txt file.
 - To create custom keybinds, simply create a new .txt file in the same directory as Keyboard Assistant's .exe file, and type the name into the appropriate spot in the config.txt file!
     - To give you a little push, I also included fnaf.txt, which is already configured to play Five Nights
       at Freddy's, right off the bat!
